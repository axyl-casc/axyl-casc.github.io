# axyl-casc.github.io

This site is now built with **React** and Tailwind CSS. It includes two entry pages:
- `index.html` for the main portfolio
- `other_projects.html` for additional projects

Both pages load React from a CDN and render components defined in `src/js/main.jsx`.

## Local development

Run the site locally with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This compiles the Tailwind CSS and launches a small server at `http://localhost:8080`.
